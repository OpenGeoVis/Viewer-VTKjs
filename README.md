# gpvis
This repo is strictly for the purpose of hosting the vtk.js standalone web viewer found [here](https://kitware.github.io/vtk-js/examples/StandaloneSceneLoader.html) on the domain [gpvis.org](http://gpvis.org) for the [ParaViewGeophysics](https://github.com/banesullivan/ParaViewGeophysics) code base.

The current hosted viewer was created by Kitware (Copyright (c) 2016, Kitware Inc.) and we are simply hosting it for use here until the viewer we are developing using the vtk.js library is finished.
